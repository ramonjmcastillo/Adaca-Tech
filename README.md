Time spent on the challenge.

It took almost the fours duration because I wanted to slowly improvement the app and was refactoring the code to make it cleaner and more maintanable

Trade Offs Made:
Because of the deadline, I had to focus on the requirements first and foremost. I wanted to improvement the styling, add tests and check the responsiveness of the app on other screens.
